The I2MC algorithm was designed to accomplish fixation detection in data across a wide range of noise levels and when periods of data loss may occur.

Quick start guide for adopting this script for your own data:
1) Build an import function specific for your data (see importTobiiTX300 for an example). 

2) Change line 106 to use your new import function. The format should be:

data.time for the timestamp
data.left.X & data.left.Y for left gaze coordinates
data.right.X & data.right.Y for right gaze coordinates
data.average.X & data.average.Y for average of right and left gaze coordinates

You may provide coordinates from both eyes, only the left, only the right, or only the average. 
Gaze coordinates should be in pixels, timestamps should be in milliseconds

3) Adjust the variables in the "necessary variables" section to match your
   data
4) Run the algorithm

Note: Signal Processing Toolbox is required for the default downsampling procedure. If not available, set opt.downsampFilter to 0. This will use a different downsampling procedure.

Tested on MATLAB R2012a, R2014b & R2016a
