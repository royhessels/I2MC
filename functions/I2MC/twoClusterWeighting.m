% Calculates 2-means cluster weighting for eye-tracking data
%
% Input:
% xpos,ypos                     = horizontal and vertical coordinates from eye-tracker over which to calculate 2-means clustering
% missingn                      = boolean indicating which samples are missing
% downsamples                   = downsample levels used for data (1/no downsampling is always done, don't specify that) 
% downsampFilter                = use chebychev filter when downsampling? 1: yes, 0: no. requires signal processing toolbox. is what matlab's downsampling functions do, but could cause trouble (ringing) with the hard edges in eye-movement data
% chebyOrder                    = order of Chebyshev downsampling filter
% windowtime                    = time window (s) over which to calculate 2-means clustering (choose value so that max. 1 saccade can occur)
% steptime                      = time window (s) in each iteration. Use zero for sample by sample processing
% freq                          = sampling frequency of data
% maxerrors                     = maximum number of errors allowed in k-means clustering procedure before proceeding to next file
%
% Output:
% finalweights                  = vector of 2-means clustering weights (one weight for each sample), the higher, the more likely a saccade happened
% stopped                       = whether maxerrors was reached or not
