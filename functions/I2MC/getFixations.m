%% calculate fixation duration
% if you calculate fixation duration by means of time of last sample during
% fixation minus time of first sample during fixation (our fixation markers
% are inclusive), then you always underestimate fixation duration by one
% sample because you're in practice counting to the beginning of the
% sample, not the end of it. To solve this, as end time we need to take the
% timestamp of the sample that is one past the last sample of the fixation.
% so, first calculate fixation duration by simple timestamp subtraction.
fixdur      = endtime-starttime;
% then determine what duration of this last sample was
extratime   = timestamp(min(fixend+1,length(timestamp)))-timestamp(fixend); % make sure we don't run off the end of the data
% if last fixation ends at end of data, we need to determine how long that
% sample is and add that to the end time. Here we simply guess it as the
% duration of previous sample
if ~isempty(fixend) && fixend(end)==length(timestamp)   % first check if there are fixations in the first place, or we'll index into non-existing data
    extratime(end) = diff(timestamp(end-1:end));
end
% now add the duration of the end sample to fixation durations, so we have
% correct fixation durations
fixdur      = fixdur+extratime;
