function [interpwins] = findInterpWins(xpos,ypos,missing,windowtime,edgesamples,freq,maxdisp)
% find interpolation windows over missingvalue in signal, only if edges of
% window do not exceed a maximum dispersion

% input:
% pos           = position signal (either x or y coordinate)
% windowtime    = time of window to interpolate over in ms
% edgesamples   = number of samples at window edge used for interpolating
%                   in ms
% freq          = frequency of measurement
% missingvalue  = value that corresponds to eye lost in position signal
% maxdisp       = maximum dispersion in position signal (i.e. if signal is
%                   in pixels, provide maxdisp in n pixels)

% output:
% interpwins    = valid indices for interpolation, interpolate using
%                   windowedspline.m
